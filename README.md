# The Evolution of Labile Traits in Sex- and Age-Structured Populations

This reporsitory contains R code to implement the example in the manuscript, "The Evolution of Labile Traits in Sex- and Age-Structured Populations," submitted to Journal of Animal Ecology.

To do list:

* Describe how to use the R code (it works, but commenting is sparse).

* Link the example model to data in the forthcoming Wytham great tit data paper.

* Add code to simulate data to allow users to experiment with different life histories?
